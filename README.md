# odin-landing-page

This was an assignment given by The Odin Project as a way to test, develop and refine basic HTML & CSS. 

Having studied flexbox right before this assignment, I was then tasked to recreate a mockup in my own IDE. It's a basic landing page that could be used as a template for any websites I develop going forward.
